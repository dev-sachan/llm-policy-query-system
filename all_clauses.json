Cumulative Bonus\na) A 10% cumulative bonus will be applied on the Sum Insured for next policy year under the Policy after\nevery CLAIM FREE Policy Year, provided that the Policy is renewed with Us and without a break. The maximum\ncumulative bonus shall not exceed 100% of the Sum Insured in any Policy Year.\nb) In relation to a Family Floater, the cumulative bonus so applied will only be available in respect of\nclaims made by those Insured Persons who were Insured Persons in the claim free Policy Year and continue to be\nInsured Persons in the subsequent Policy Year.\nc) If a cumulative bonus has been applied and a claim is made, then in the subsequent Policy Year We will\nautomatically decrease the cumulative bonus by 10% of the Sum Insured in that following Policy Year. There will\nbe no impact on the Inpatient Sum Insured, only the accrued cumulative bonus will be decreased.\nd) If the Insured Persons in the expiring policy are covered on individual basis and thus have accumulated\nthe no claim bonus for each member in the expiring policy, and such expiring policy is renewed with Us on a\nFamily Floater basis, then the no claim bonus to be carried forward for credit in the Policy would be the least no\nclaim bonus amongst all the Insured Persons.\ne) Portability/migration benefit will be offered to the extent of sum of previous sum insured and accrued\ncumulative bonus (if opted for), portability/migration benefit shall not apply to any other additional increased\nsum insured.\nf) In policies with a two year Policy Period, the application of above guidelines of Cumulative Bonus shall\nbe post completion of each policy year.",
